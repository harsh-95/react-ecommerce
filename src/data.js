    info:
      "Samsung's brand new Galaxy S7 is a subtle improvement over its predecessor on the outside, but a whole new beast on the inside. Powered by the Exynos 8890 SoC, this phone can blaze through absolutely anything you throw at it, with power to spare. The camera is absolutely amazing, especially in low light. This is a pragmatic phone, compared to its sibling the Galaxy S7 Edge, and is better value for money if you don't want to show off. However, with competition at an all-time high, you can also get most of its features and functions for one third this price.",

    info:
      "The HTC 10 is a beautifully crafted smartphone with a gorgeous display and an ergonomic design. This phone is the first to have optical image stabilisation for the front facing camera, which does help when shooting in low light. The phone has very snappy performance thanks to the Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The USB Type-C port gets USB 3.1 Gen 1 speeds for faster data transfers. Sense UI is now leaner than ever, with many of the custom apps traded in favour of Google's native apps. Camera performance is good thanks to the 12 Ultrapixel 2 sensor, OIS and laser autofocus. The built-in battery lasts an entire day but doesn't do too well if you watch a lot of videos. Overall, the HTC 10 is a solid flagship that can go toe-to-toe with the best in the business.      ",
